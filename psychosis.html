		<h1>Psychosis</h1>
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtUZvsVI56o&pp=ygUJcHN5Y2hvc2lz"></iframe>
		<p>People affected by psychosis can experience delusions, hallucinations and confused thinking. Psychosis can occur in a number of mental illnesses, including drug-induced psychosis, schizophrenia and mood disorders. Medication and psychological support can relieve, or even eliminate, psychotic symptoms.</p><br>

		<h2>Symptoms of psychosis</h2>
		<p>Symptoms of psychosis include:</p><br>
		<ul>
			<li>confused thinking</li><br>
			<li>delusions – false beliefs that are not shared by others</li><br>
			<li>hallucinations – hearing, seeing, smelling or tasting somethingthat isn't there</li><br>
			<li>changed behaviours and feelings.</li><br>
		</ul>

		<h2>Confused thinking and psychosis</h2>
		<p>During an episode of psychosis a person’s thoughts become confused. Words and ideas lose their meaning or take on meanings that make no sense.<BR>These disturbances in thinking can affect a person's ability to concentrate, remember things and make plans. Confused thinking can continue, even after the psychotic episode has ended.<BR>You may be able to tell that someone is having an episode of psychosis through changes in their speech. These may include:</p><br>
		<ul>
			<li>speaking very quickly or slowly</li><br>
			<li>changing topics frequently</li><br>
			<li>speaking in muddled-up sentences</li><br>
			<li>using the wrong words to describe things</li><br>
			<li>making up words.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Delusions and psychosis</h2>
		<p>Delusions are false beliefs that are not shared by others. Delusions can take various forms, including:</p><br>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>paranoid delusion</strong> – for example, the person believes they are being watched and singled out for some harmful purpose</li><br>
			<li><strong>grandiose delusion</strong> – for example, the person believes they have special powers or that they are an important religious or political figure</li><br>
			<li><strong>reference delusion</strong> – for example, the person believes they are receiving special messages or codes through media such as TV shows, songs or advertising</li><br>
			<li><strong>control delusion</strong> – for example, the person believes their thoughts are being controlled or influenced by outside forces such as aliens, some real or invented group, an individual or something more vague</li><br>
			<li><strong>somatic delusion</strong> – for example, the person believes something has happened to their body – something is wrong with it, some part of it is missing or dead, they have a disease or are infested with parasites</li><br>
			<li><strong>depressive delusion</strong> – for example, the person believes they are guilty of some terrible crime.</li><br>
		</ul>

		<h2>Hallucinations and psychosis</h2>
		<p>A hallucination is when someone hears, sees, smells or tastes something that isn't there. A common form of hallucination is to hear voices that aren't there. Hallucinations can lead to agitation, distress, frustration and even hostility.</p><br>

		<h2>Changed behaviour and psychosis</h2>
		<p>Psychosis can affect a person’s behaviour. A person with psychosis may experience:</p>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>social isolation or becoming withdrawn</li><br>
			<li>problems with work, social or family life</li><br>
			<li>problems with motivation</li><br>
			<li>problems with increased activity</li><br>
			<li>laughing at inappropriate times or becoming upset without an identifiable cause.
			</li><br>

		</ul>

		<h2>Changed feelings and psychosis</h2>
		<p>Psychosis can lead to changes in emotions. How a person feels can change for no obvious reason. Examples may include:</p><br>
		<ul>
			<li>feeling strange and cut off from the world</li><br>
			<li>mood swings, feeling unusually excited or depressed</li><br>
			<li>feeling or showing less emotion</li><br>
			<li>feeling distanced or detached from one's body or thoughts</li><br>
		</ul>

		<h2>Types of psychotic illness</h2>
		<p>There are a number of mental illnesses where psychotic symptoms can be present. Examples include:</p><br>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>brief reactive psychosis</strong> – psychotic symptoms that arise due to a very stressful event and last less than a month</li><br>
			<li><strong>drug induced psychosis</strong> – caused by drugs such as alcohol, speed, LSD, marijuana, ecstasy or magic mushrooms. The symptoms last until the effects of the drugs wear off (hours or days)</li><br>
			<li><strong>schizophrenia</strong> – most people affected by schizophrenia experience a range of psychotic symptoms and commonly have difficulty organising their thoughts
			</li><br>
			<li><strong>bipolar disorder</strong> – involves very extreme moods (either very high or very low) that can lead to psychotic symptoms</li><br>
			<li><strong>psychotic depression</strong> – depression can be so intense that it causes psychotic symptoms.</li><br>
		</ul>

		<h2>Causes of psychosis</h2>
		<p>The causes of psychosis are not fully understood. It is likely that psychosis is caused by a number of factors including:</p><br>
		<ul>
			<li>genetic vulnerability – family history of psychotic disorder</li><br>
			<li>chemical imbalance in the brain</li><br>
			<li>substance use, particularly cannabis, speed or ice</li><br>
			<li>environmental factors</li><br>
			<li>psychosocial stress – for people who have had an episode of psychosis, significant stress may be a factor in the development of further episodes.</li><br>
		</ul>

		<h2>Diagnosis of psychosis</h2>
		<p>The presence of psychotic symptoms does not automatically mean that someone has a psychotic disorder.<br>To diagnose a psychotic disorder, a mental health professional will do a comprehensive medical and psychological assessment over time. This can be done either at home or in hospital. They will check for psychosis caused by drugs or other diseases first.</p><br>

		<h2>Treatment for psychosis</h2>
		<p>Treatment can do much to relieve, or even eliminate, the symptoms of psychosis. Treatments include:</p><br>
		<ul>
			<li>medication – certain medications such as anti-psychotics help the brain to restore its normal chemical balance</li><br>
			<li>community support programs – ongoing support may be needed to help a person experiencing psychosis to live independently in the community. Support may include help with accommodation, finding suitable work, and the development of social and personal skills</li><br>
			<li>psychological therapies such as psychotherapy, cognitive-behaviour therapy, family therapy and counselling are aimed at teaching skills and techniques for coping with stress, improving quality of life and helping people to manage their symptoms</li><br>
			<li>self-help and peer support groups</li><br>
			<li>lifestyle changes – such as improving general health and reducing stress through activities such as art, music and exercise can support recovery. Avoiding drugs and alcohol and getting good sleep can also help.</li><br>
		</ul>
