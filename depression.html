		<h1>Depression</h1>
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rcqL1YCay0&pp=ygULIGRlcHJlc3Npb24%3D"></iframe>
		<p>Depression is a mental illness that may be mild or severe. Types include major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, dysthymic and cyclothymic disorders, postnatal depression and seasonal affective disorder. Seek help early to avoid the risk of other mental health problems.</p>

		<h2>Depression is common</h2>
		<p>In any one year, around one million people in Australia experience depression. One in six women and one in eight men will experience depression at some time in their life. The good news is, depression is treatable and effective treatments are available. The sooner a person with depression seeks support, the sooner they can recover.</p>

		<h2>Symptoms of depression</h2>
		<p>Depression affects how people think, feel and act. Depression makes it more difficult to manage from day to day and interferes with study, work and relationships. A person may be depressed if for more than two weeks they have felt sad, down or miserable most of the time or have lost interest or pleasure in most of their usual activities, and have also experienced several of the signs and symptoms across at least three of the categories in the list below. It’s important to note, everyone experiences some of these symptoms from time to time and it may not necessarily mean a person is depressed. Equally, not every person who is experiencing depression will have all of these symptoms.</p><br><br>

		<h2>Feelings caused by depression</h2>
		<p>A person with depression may feel:</p><br><br>

		<ul>
			<li>Sad</li>
			<li>Miserable</li>
			<li>Unhappy</li>
			<li>Irritable</li>
			<li>Overwhelmed</li>
			<li>Guilty</li>
			<li>Fustraded</li>
			<li>Lack Of Confidence</li>
			<li>Indecisive</li>
			<li>Unable To Concentrate</li>
			<li>Disappointed</li>
		</ul>



		<h2>Thoughts caused by depression</h2>
		<p>A person with depression may have thoughts such as:</p><br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>‘I’m a failure.’</li>
			<li>‘It’s my fault.’</li>
			<li>‘Nothing good ever happens to me.’</li>
			<li>‘Things will never change.’</li>
			<li>‘There is nothing good in my life.’</li>
			<li>‘I’m worthless.’</li>
			<li>‘Life’s not worth living.’</li>
			<li>‘People would be better off without me.’</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Behavioural symptoms of depression</h2>
		<p>A person with depression may:</p><br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>withdraw from close family and friends</li>
			<li>stop going out</li>
			<li>stop their usual enjoyable activities</li>
			<li>not get things done at work or school</li>
			<li>rely on alcohol and sedatives.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Physical symptoms of depression</h2>
		<p>A person with depression may experience:</p><br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>being tired all the time</li>
			<li>feeling sick and ‘run down’</li>
			<li>frequent headaches, stomach or muscle pains</li>
			<li>a churning gut</li>
			<li>sleep problems</li>
			<li>loss or change of appetite</li>
			<li>significant weight loss or gain.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Causes of depression</h2>
		<p>While the exact cause of depression isn’t known, a number of things can be associated with its development. Generally, depression does not result from a single event, but from a combination of biological, psychological, social and lifestyle factors.</p><br><br>


		<h2>Personal factors that can lead to depression</h2>
		<p>Personal factors that can lead to a risk of depression include:</p><br><br>
		<ul>
			<p><li>family history – depression can run in families and some people will be at an increased genetic risk. However, this doesn’t mean that a person will automatically experience depression if a parent or close relative has had the condition</li>
			<li>personality – some people may be more at risk because of their personality, particularly if they tend to worry a lot, have low self-esteem, are perfectionists, are sensitive to personal criticism, or are self-critical and negative</li>
			<li>serious medical conditions – these can trigger depression in two ways. Serious conditions can bring about depression directly or can contribute to depression through the associated stress and worry, especially if it involves long-term management of a condition or chronic pain</li>
			<li>drug and alcohol use – can both lead to and result from depression. Many people with depression also have drug and alcohol problems.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Life events and depression</h2>
		<p>Research suggests that continuing difficulties, such as long-term unemployment, living in an abusive or uncaring relationship, long-term isolation or loneliness or prolonged exposure to stress at work can increase the risk of depression.<br>Significant adverse life events, such as losing a job, going through a separation or divorce, or being diagnosed with a serious illness, may also trigger depression, particularly among people who are already at risk because of genetic, developmental or other personal factors.</p><br><br>

		<h2>Seek support for symptoms of depression</h2>
		<p>Depression is often not recognised and can go on for months or even years if left untreated. It’s important to seek support as early as possible, as the sooner a person gets treatment, the sooner they can recover.<br>Untreated depression can have many negative effects on a person’s life, including serious relationship and family problems, difficulty finding and holding down a job, and drug and alcohol problems.<br>There is no one proven way that people recover from depression. However, there is a range of effective treatments and health professionals who can help people on the road to recovery.<br>There are also many things that people with depression can do for themselves to help them recover and stay well. The important thing is to find the right treatment and the right health professional for a person’s needs.</p><br><br>

		<h2>Types of depression</h2>
		<p>There are different types of depression. The symptoms for each can range from relatively minor through to severe.</p><br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Major depression</li>
			<li>Melancholia</li>
			<li>Dysthymia</li>
			<li>Psychotic depression</li>
			<li>Antenatal and postnatal depression</li>
			<li>Bipolar disorder</li>
			<li>Cyclothymic disorder</li>
			<li>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)</li>
